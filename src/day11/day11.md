The goal of this challenge is to create a generic type that takes an object as input and transform each key to `readonly`. The real challenging part though is that there can be nested objects and their keys should also become readonly.

The best explanation for this exercise was actually given [here](https://typehero.dev/challenge/deep-readonly/solutions/713).
