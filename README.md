# Advent of TypeScript 2023

## Content

This repository contains the challenges I was able to solve as part of the advent of TypeScript 2023 event. Each folder contains a challenge and a markdown file in which I state the challenge and I explain my solution. As a sidenote, I think these challenges are a very nice way to learn TypeScript as they are very hands-on and practical. This way a developer can avoid tutorial hell and actually practice the concept they learn.
